For our t-shirt, we wanted to encode all of our names as the fixed points in a Hopfield network and put the weight matrix on the t-shirt. Well, that wasn't a good idea because for one thing- what's a human gonna do with a weight matrix except appreciate that it means something, and putting a weight matrix on a t-shirt isn't feasible anyway. So we built a website to host the network!

To look at the network in practice, go [here](/hopfield/). For details on the code and simulations, go [here](/code/). Otherwise, enjoy our course photos :).
