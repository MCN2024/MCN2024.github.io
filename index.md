For our t-shirt, we wanted to encode all of our names as the fixed points in a Hopfield network. The amazing team of Mo and Maxime were able to build a network, but turns out printing a weight matrix on a t-shirt is too much to ask. So we made a website to host it. We're still working on turning the fixed points in the network into a bunch of gifs we can put on the website, so in the meantime, check out our course photos.
