title: Captured by Hopfield

For our t-shirt, we wanted to encode all of our names as the fixed points in a Hopfield network. The amazing team of Mo and Maxime were able to build a network, but turns out printing a weight matrix on a t-shirt is too much to ask. So we made a website to host it.

Unless it wasn't too much to ask and the course indeed did ask for the weight matrix :) Either way, we can host stuff here to document our time at the course.
